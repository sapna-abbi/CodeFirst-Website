              Morocco is a gateway to Africa, and a country of dizzying diversity. Here you'll find epic mountain ranges, ancient cities, sweeping deserts – and warm hospitality.
              Bustling cities, laid-back beaches and historic sights galore; you’ll find all this and more on holidays to Morocco, served with a generous helping of North African sunshine.
              Morocco offers all the exotic attraction of a Middle Eastern holiday, combined with some unique African character.
              That all comes together to make Morocco a dazzling feast for the senses, and a great spot for some serious sunbathing, too!
              Souk-filled Marrakech is a popular destination, where you’ll discover a fascinating medina and the towering Atlas Mountains within easy reach.
              You’re not far from Agadir over on the Atlantic coast, with its long sandy beach and crumbling Kasbah. Or you could choose the chilled-out seaside town of Essaouira if you really want to get away from it all.

            <span class="title">Norway</span>
            <p>
              Norway is a Scandinavian country encompassing mountains, glaciers and deep coastal fjords. Oslo, the capital,
              is a city of green spaces and museums. Preserved 9th-century Viking ships are displayed at Oslo’s Viking Ship Museum.
              Bergen, with colorful wooden houses, is the starting point for cruises to the dramatic Sognefjord.
              Norway is also known for fishing, hiking and skiing, notably at Lillehammer’s Olympic resort.

              The first sight that greets most visitors to Norway is Oslo, Norway’s capital city and home to Gardermoen Airport,
              the country’s major international gateway. As Norway’s seat of government, the city also serves as the country’s cultural
              and economic centre. But despite its status as Norway’s largest city with a metro population of 1.7 million residents,
              Oslo is well known for its “small town” feel and natural beauty in addition to its abundant cultural and historical
              attractions.

              The city itself is an interesting blend of traditional Scandinavian design and modern cosmopolitan influences.
              This fusion of “old meets new” can be seen in places like Aker Brygge, the old waterfront area that is now a buzzing
              neighbourhood of trendy shops, bars and restaurants next to some of Oslo’s most historic landmarks, such as the
              Akershus Fortress and the Royal Palace.

              The Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park runs along the high Dovrefjell mountain chain, considered to be the "backbone"
              of Norway and the conceptual barrier between the country’s southern and central regions. The park is home to several
              unique species of indigenous fauna as well as wolverines, elk, wild reindeer, lynx, golden eagles, Arctic foxes and
              a rare herd of musk ox — a species that died out in Europe after the last Ice Age but was reintroduced from Greenland.
              Dovrefjell is now the only place in Norway, and one of the few places on earth, where you can still see this mighty
              creature in its natural habitat. This area is also an ideal destination for activities like hiking, biking, cross-country
              skiing and guided musk ox safaris. The gateway to the park is in the town of Dombås.

            <span class="title">Sydney</span>
            <p>
              Capital of New South Wales and one of Australia's largest cities, is best known for its harbour-front Sydney Opera House,
              with a distinctive sail-like design. Massive Darling Harbour and the smaller Circular Quay port are hubs of waterside life,
              with the arched Harbour Bridge and esteemed Royal Botanic Garden nearby. Sydney Tower’s outdoor platform, the Skywalk,
              offers 360-degree views of the city and suburbs.

              After Dark
              After a lazy Saturday at the beach, urbane Sydneysiders have a disco nap, hit the showers and head out again.
              There's always a new restaurant to try, undercover bar to hunt down, hip band to check out, sports team to shout at,
              show to see or crazy party to attend. The city's pretensions to glamour are well balanced by a casualness that means a
              cool T-shirt and a tidy pair of jeans will get you in most places. But if you want to dress up and show off, there's plenty
              of opportunity for that among the sparkling harbour lights.

              Making a Splash
              Defined just as much by its rugged Pacific coastline as its exquisite harbour, Sydney relies on its coastal setting
              to replenish its reserves of charm; venture too far away from the water and the charm suddenly evaporates. Jump on a
              ferry and Sydney's your oyster – the harbour prises the city's two halves far enough apart to reveal an abundance of pearls.
              On the coast, Australia ends abruptly in sheer walls of sandstone punctuated by arcs of golden sand. In summer they're
              covered with bronzed bodies making the most of a climate that encourages outdoor socialising, exercising, flirting and fun.

              Show Pony
              Brash is the word that inevitably gets bandied around when it comes to describing the Harbour City, and let's face it,
              compared to its Australian sister cities, Sydney is loud, uncompromising and in your face. Fireworks displays are more
              dazzling here, heels are higher, bodies more buffed, contact sports more brutal, starlets shinier, drag queens glitzier
              and prices higher. Australia’s best musos, foodies, actors, stockbrokers, models, writers and architects flock to the
              city to make their mark, and the effect is dazzling: a hyper-energetic, ambitious, optimistic and unprincipled marketplace
              of the soul, where anything goes and everything usually does.

            <span class="title">Taiwan</span>
            <p>
              Taiwan - 180km east of China, is known for modern cities, traditional Chinese temples, hot springs resorts
              and dramatic mountainous terrain. Taipei, in the north, has a number of busy night markets, as well as Chinese Imperial art
              at the National Palace Museum. Taipei 101, a 509m-tall, bamboo-shaped skyscraper with an observation deck, rises above the
              city. With legacies as varied as its adventure landscape and spirited traditions thriving alongside the cream of Asian
              sophistication, Taiwan is a continent on one green island.

              The Beautiful Isle
              Famed for centuries as Ilha Formosa (Beautiful Isle; 美麗島; Měilìdǎo), this is a land with more sides than the 11-headed
              Guanyin. Towering sea cliffs, marble-walled gorges and tropical forests are just the start of your journey, which could
              take you as far as Yushan, Taiwan's 3952m alpine roof.In Taiwan you can criss-cross mountains on colonial-era hiking trails
              or cycle a lone highway with the blue Pacific on one side and green volcanic arcs on the other. And if you simply want a
              classic landscape to enjoy, you'll find them around every corner.

              Have You Eaten?
              'Have you eaten?' The words are used as a greeting here, and the answer is always 'yes', as there's just too much nibbling
              to do. Taiwan offers the gamut of Chinese cuisines, some of the best Japanese outside Japan, and a full house of local
              specialities from Tainan milkfish and Taipei beef noodles to indigenous barbecued wild boar. Night markets around the island
              serve endless feasts of snacks including stinky tofu, steamed dumplings, oyster omelettes, shrimp rolls and shaved ice.
              And when you're thirsty you can look forward to juices from the freshest local fruits, local craft beer, aromatic teas
              and, in a surprising twist, Asia's best gourmet coffee.

              Asian Values On Their Terms
              Defying those who said it wasn't in their DNA, the Taiwanese have created Asia's most vibrant democracy and liberal society,
              with a raucous free press, gender equality, and respect for human rights and, increasingly, animal rights as well.
              The ancestors are still worshipped, and mum and dad still get their dues, but woe betide the politician who thinks
              it's the people who must pander, and not him – or her. If you want to catch a glimpse of the people's passion for protest,
              check out Taipei Main Station on most weekends, or just follow the local news.

              The Tao of Today
              Taiwan is heir to the entire Chinese tradition of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and that amorphous collection of deities
              and demons worshipped as folk faith. Over the centuries the people have blended their way into a unique and tolerant
              religious culture that's often as ritual heavy as Catholicism and as wild as Santeria. Taiwanese temples (all 15,000)
              combine worship hall, festival venue and art house under one roof. Watch a plague boat burn at Donglong Temple,
              go on a pilgrimage with the Empress of Heaven, study a rooftop three-dimensional mosaic, and learn why a flag and ball
              have come to represent prayer.
